## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antedebaas/restic-scheduler.git
cd restic-scheduler
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/restic-scheduler /usr/local/bin/
```

### From Crates.io

```bash
cargo install restic-scheduler
```

### RPM Package (Fedora/RHEL)

RPM packages are available through COPR. The package includes systemd service files and proper user/group setup.

After installing the RPM package, you need to enable the systemd timers for your desired profiles:

```bash
# Enable daily backups for default profile
sudo systemctl enable restic-backup@default.timer
sudo systemctl start restic-backup@default.timer

# Enable weekly repository checks
sudo systemctl enable restic-check@default.timer
sudo systemctl start restic-check@default.timer
```

## Configuration

Copy the example configuration to `/etc/restic-scheduler/config.toml` and customize it for your needs:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/restic-scheduler
sudo cp config.example.toml /etc/restic-scheduler/config.toml
sudo chown restic-scheduler:restic-scheduler /etc/restic-scheduler/config.toml
sudo chmod 640 /etc/restic-scheduler/config.toml
```

### Configuration Structure

The configuration file supports:

- **Global Settings**: Verbosity and logging directory
- **Multiple Profiles**: Each with its own repository, paths, and settings
- **Backend Configuration**: B2 or S3-compatible storage settings
- **Retention Policies**: Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly retention
- **Notifications**: Email SMTP, webhook, and custom command configurations
- **Repository Checks**: Integrity verification settings

### Example Profile Configuration

```toml
[profiles.default]
repository = "b2:my-backup-bucket"
backup_paths = ["/home", "/etc", "/opt/important-data"]
backup_tags = ["daily-backup", "automated"]
encryption_password = "your-secure-password-here"

[profiles.default.backend.b2]
account_id = "your-b2-key-id"
account_key = "your-b2-application-key"
connections = 10

[profiles.default.retention]
hours = 24
days = 14
weeks = 8
months = 12
years = 5

[profiles.default.notifications.email]
notify_on_failure = true
smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
smtp_port = 587
smtp_username = "your-email@gmail.com"
smtp_password = "your-app-password"
from = "your-email@gmail.com"
to = ["admin@example.com"]
use_tls = true

[profiles.default.notifications.command]
notify_on_failure = true
command = "/usr/local/bin/notify-backup"
args = ["--profile", "default", "--slack"]
timeout = 30
```

```

## Systemd Integration

The package includes systemd service and timer units for automated scheduling:

### Service Files

- `restic-backup@.service` - Backup service template with capability-based privileges
- `restic-backup@.timer` - Backup timer template
- `restic-check@.service` - Repository check service template with capability-based privileges
- `restic-check@.timer` - Repository check timer template

#### Service Security Features

The systemd services implement security best practices:

- **Dedicated User**: Runs as `restic-scheduler` user (not root)
- **Linux Capabilities**: Uses minimal required capabilities:
  - `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` - Read files regardless of DAC permissions
  - `CAP_FOWNER` - Override file ownership checks
  - `CAP_CHOWN` - Change file ownership when needed
- **Supplementary Groups**: Member of `backup` group for directory access
- **Filesystem Protection**: Limited filesystem access with specific read/write paths
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and I/O scheduling optimized for background operation

### Enable Automated Backups

```bash
# Enable daily backups for default profile
sudo systemctl enable restic-backup@default.timer
sudo systemctl start restic-backup@default.timer

# Enable weekly repository checks
sudo systemctl enable restic-check@default.timer
sudo systemctl start restic-check@default.timer

# Check timer status
sudo systemctl list-timers restic-*

# View backup logs
sudo journalctl -u restic-backup@default.service -f
```

### Privilege Management

Restic Scheduler uses a capability-based privilege system when running as systemd services:

- **Service User**: Runs as `restic-scheduler` user with minimal privileges
- **Linux Capabilities**: Uses `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`, `CAP_FOWNER`, and `CAP_CHOWN` for file access
- **Supplementary Groups**: Automatically added to `backup` group for accessing protected directories
- **Secure Access**: Can read system files and backup directories without full root privileges

#### Granting Access to Protected Directories

To allow restic-scheduler to backup directories that require elevated privileges:

```bash
# Add directories to the backup group
sudo chgrp -R backup /path/to/protected/directory
sudo chmod -R g+r /path/to/protected/directory

# Or add specific users' directories to backup group
sudo usermod -a -G backup username
```

#### Manual Privilege Escalation

For interactive use, you may need to run with elevated privileges:

```bash
# Run backup with sudo if accessing protected paths
sudo restic-scheduler backup

# Or configure sudo rules for specific operations
echo "username ALL=(restic-scheduler) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/restic-scheduler" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/restic-scheduler
```

#### Systemd Service Configuration

The systemd services are configured with security hardening:

```bash
# View service configuration
systemctl cat restic-backup@default.service

# Check service status and capabilities
systemctl status restic-backup@default.service
sudo systemd-analyze security restic-backup@default.service

# Monitor service logs
journalctl -fu restic-backup@default.service
```

#### Troubleshooting Permissions

If backups fail due to permission issues:

```bash
# Check what the service user can access
sudo -u restic-scheduler ls -la /path/to/backup/directory

# Verify group membership
id restic-scheduler

# Check systemd service capabilities
systemctl show restic-backup@default.service | grep -i cap

# Test backup manually as service user
sudo -u restic-scheduler /usr/bin/restic-scheduler --profile default backup
```

## Statistics and Monitoring

Restic Scheduler logs backup statistics in JSON format:

### JSON Format
Statistics are always logged to stdout and optionally saved as JSON Lines files in the configured directory:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/restic-scheduler/default.jsonl
```

All statistics are output to stdout for log aggregation systems like ELK stack or Prometheus.

## Log Rotation

Restic-scheduler provides comprehensive log rotation capabilities to manage log file growth and prevent disk space issues.

### Built-in Log Rotation

Configure automatic log rotation in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[global]
stats_dir = "/var/log/restic-scheduler"

# Log rotation configuration
[global.log_rotation]
max_log_size_mb = 100        # Rotate when files exceed 100MB
max_log_age_days = 30        # Clean up files older than 30 days
compress_rotated = true      # Compress rotated files with gzip
max_rotated_files = 10       # Keep up to 10 rotated files per log
```

### Manual Cleanup

You can manually clean up old statistics files using the built-in command:

```bash
# Clean up statistics older than 2 years
restic-scheduler stats --cleanup-older-than 2
```

### Statistics Commands

```bash
# View recent backup statistics
restic-scheduler backup-stats

# Generate monthly report
restic-scheduler backup-stats --year 2024

# Performance summary for last week
restic-scheduler backup-stats --days 7

# Maintenance: clean old statistics
restic-scheduler backup-stats --cleanup-older-than 3
```

## Security Considerations

- Store encryption passwords securely using external commands
- Use application-specific passwords for email notifications
- Restrict configuration file permissions (640 recommended)
- Run as dedicated user (restic-scheduler) with minimal privileges
- Use Linux capabilities instead of running as root
- Configure backup group permissions for protected directories
- Regularly test backup restoration procedures
- Monitor backup success/failure notifications
- Review systemd service security settings periodically

## Dependencies

- **restic**: The restic backup program must be installed and available in PATH
